stepover doesn't work as last statement.
A line with two functions, stepping into then out of one will break shit;
when debugger statement is in the first line it ignores the pause.
undefined in call stack
when stepping out, should return to the same line
add function end debug statement
remove yields from runtime
work on timers and event runtime
